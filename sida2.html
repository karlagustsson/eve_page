				Players start the game by either selecting a previously created character or by creating a new one. Each Eve Online account allows for up to three characters. When a player creates a new character, they start by choosing one of the four playable races - Amarr, Gallente, Minmatar, or Caldari. Each race is further divided into three bloodlines that give characters different pre-defined appearances, which can be finely tuned by the player.

				Unlike many other MMOs, where there are numerous copies of the game universe intended to run at once (i.e., servers), Eve Online is functionally a single-universe game. There are technically four copies of the universe running (the main server "Tranquility", the Chinese-based "Serenity", the event test server "Duality" that focused on organized events like mass tests and playtests coordinated by CCP and the test server "Singularity" which is subject to periodic wipes when new content is being tested) but rather than starting a new "realm" when in-game population increases, CCP simply adds new features to the existing game environment.
